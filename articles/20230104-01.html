<p>Apple,</p>

<p>Repairibility is more important than you think, and your behaviour lately is causing your brand significant reputational damage.  I love Macs, and have been using them essentially my entire life, but my relationship with you is at its breaking point.</p>

<p>You might not realize this, but things go wrong all the time.  Sometimes bad designs make it into products.  Sometimes accidents happen and great products take abuse at the hand of their users.  That's life.  We are all human after all.</p>

<p>When things go wrong, the mature thing to do is to own up to the mistakes, and do what's necessary to make things right.  Are all of the problems your fault?  No, not by a long shot.  I work in IT; I know how hard users are on their tech.  But, you are not entirely blameless either.  You have occasionally sent products out into the world with design flaws, and when you do, you are not doing right by your users.</p>

<p>Why do you act this way?  I can only speculate, but I suspect it's cost.  When you are faced with eating the repair costs of devices that are difficult and expensive to fix, you try to weasel out of it first try blaming users, then when that doesn't work, you bring out your lawyers.  This is not becoming behaviour.  Shame on you.</p>

<p>Perhaps a simple solution to this is to design with repairability in mind, so when you need to repair devices, it can be done easily and inexpensively.  Sure, this will hurt your short-term gains since people won't need to rush to you to buy new, but there are other indirect benefits you will reap:</p>

<p>Being an industry leader on the right-to-repair movement would be a great talking point for your advertising campaigns.  This would show that you <em>actually</em> care about the environment by trying to reduce e-waste.  When you're not trying to actively booby-trap your own designs, you've proven capable of designing great, reliable things.</p>

<p>You could create an entire business around providing resources, parts, and tools to repair shops.  It seems like you don't actually want to repair devices, so by enabling others to do the work, you give your customers true choice, and make money while doing so.</p> 

<p>And last, and probably most importantly, you will see increased brand loyalty.  The knowledge that Apple is there for their users when they have computer troubles will find you lifetime customers.  I was one of them, until you changed.</p>

<p>I want to continue being an Apple user, advocate, and fan, but I can't in good conscience do so unless I see a drastic shift in the way you operate.  I'm still hopeful that you'll get your priorities straightened out eventually, but I'm not going to wait.  My next daily driver will likely be a <a href="https://frame.work/">Framework</a>, and I'll become better acquainted with Linux because I can afford to, and sadly, you've forced my hand.</p>

<p>Best of luck, and hopefully we can become reacquainted soon,</p>
